Test Git Quick Start demo

Let's start collaborating on this document.

Some text:
I'm going to write a first paragraph here, then I'll see if I can commit it separately from the rest of the file.

I'm going to start a list.

1. Apple
2. Les oranges
3. Aguacate
4. Pears

~Now, Amine, you change item 2 on the list and then commit and push.~
Done. Your turn, Andrés.
You are about to have a conflict. Put yours as number 2, move mine to number 3 and Pears becomes 4.
~Done. Your turn, Andrés.~
OK, sorted!


And this is the second paragraph. I'm not a 100% sure how to do this, but let's find out!

OK, let's do vegetables now!

1. tomatos
2. aubergines
3. courgettes

Forget about vegetables! Let's do a colours' list!

1. Red
2. Orange
3. Green

OK, now we do a list of people:

1. Andrés
2. Anna
3. Mila
