Test Git Quick Start demo

Let's start collaborating on this document.

I'm going to start a list.

1. Apple
2. Aguacate
3. Pears

~Now, Amine, you change item 2 on the list and then commit and push.~
Done. Your turn, Andrés.
You are about to have a conflict. Put yours as number 2, move mine to number 3 and Pears becomes 4.
